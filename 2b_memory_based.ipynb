    "To save memory, we only choose recipes with more than 30 ratings and users who have given more than 100 ratings. We first build a rating matrix between users and recipes. One of the limitations with user-based collaborative filtering is that the rating matrix is very sparse for large datasets, as a given user usually would not have rated most of the items. This makes the model susceptible to capturing noise as opposed to meaningful signal. However, it is still useful to see what some users like with the information we do have."

We can then take the `user_id`s of these users and find the recipes they have rated that our user of interest has not. Next, we get an average rating across all of these users for each recipe, and recommend the top rated recipes out of these to our user of interest. You can try it out yourself below."

    "User-based and item-based recommendations both belong to memory-based collaborative filtering. The two techniques share many things in common. We create a user-item/item-user matrix with both approaches, and find recipes to recommend by evaluating the cosine similarities of a third variable, `rating`. With memory-based collaborative filtering, the assumption is that a user is similar to other users if their ratings are similar, or that a user would like similar items to what they already like based on rating alone. This assumption is often but not always true. In memory-based collaborative filtering, we do not take into account any intrinsic properties of the recipes that may have attracted users in the first place. If someone likes a a dish because there are mushrooms in it, we should try to recommend other mushroom dishes. Memory-based collaborative filtering does not do this, as we cannot tell which dishes have mushroom and which do not, simply by looking at the ratings."
